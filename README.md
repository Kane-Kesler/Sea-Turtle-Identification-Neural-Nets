## Research Goals
<div id="research-goals"></div>

This repo contains the CNN model that are built to identify individual sea turtles based on the unique segmeneted patterns on their heads. To train and test our model, we use the [SeaturtleIDHeads dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wildlifedatasets/seaturtleidheads-overview).

Note: Each row represents photos of a unique turtle.

Investigating the effects of tourism and social media on wildlife animals
can be done by using CNN models to identify the animals on social media platforms and
tracking the frequency at which they are posted [(Papafitsoros, Adam, and
Schofield 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10307).
