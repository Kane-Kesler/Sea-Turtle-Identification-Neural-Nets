# SeaturlteIDHeads-CNN-Model

Investigating the effects of tourism and social media on wildlife animals
can be done by identifying the animals on social media platforms and
tracking the frequency at which they are posted [(Papafitsoros, Adam, and
Schofield 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10307). This repo contains the CNN models that are built to identify indiviual sea turtles based on the unique segmeneted patterns on their heads.
